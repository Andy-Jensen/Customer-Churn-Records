## Project Description:
Every bank wants to hold there customers for sustaining their business and this data is from an Anonymous Multinational bank. They want to identify what causes their customers to churn. 

## Project Goal:
* Identify drivers of customer churn
* Make a predictive model of customer churn
* Deliver all results in the form of a final report

## Executive Summary:

## Initial Hypothesis:
My initial thoughts are that there will be some distinct features that are significant causes of customer churn. I think that the higher the tenure the less likely that a customer will churn. I think there will be other features that show significance such as geography, balance, credit score, and complain.
